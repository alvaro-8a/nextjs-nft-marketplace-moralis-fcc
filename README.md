<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

All the code was developed for learning purposes and is from [Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript – 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&lis) by freeCodeCamp.org and Patrick Collins

The project represents a Web3 NFT Marketplace using the moralis server to listen and save the events emited by the [NFT Marketplace smart contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3cb4F7C5f7e3355BEe1341251A8D8a2B04fBC7B7#code) 

Inside the web, users can sell/list their NFTs, buy the ones that they want and also withdraw the money of the sales they made

The moralis server offers a centralized database that, automatically, saves data when the smart contract emits an event. Althought this server is centralized, the logic remains 100% on chain (decentralized)

The use of this centralized server allows faster interactions with the web, it also has more feature richness and allow us to create a better UX (while more decentralized tools are being created)
